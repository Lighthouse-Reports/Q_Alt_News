# Q_Alt_News
Private repository for working on the alt news networks underpinning the European Q Anon ecosystem in collaboration between Lighthouse Reports, Bloomberg, Tow, and the NZZ.

# Repo Overview
- Code: this is where our notebooks and markdowns live. Use subfolders for specific investigations. 
- Data: This is where the input data that is ingested by various notebooks/markdowns live. Use subfolders corresponding to code subfolders
- Results: This is where you can save tables, figures, CSVs etc. Again, please use the same subfolders as you did for Code and Data.

# File naming conventions: 
date_name_topic, e.g., 220523_justin_network_uk_climate
When you generate outputs, e.g., intermediary results, please set up the scripts so that file names are generated following this convention.
